AS3 Effects
===========

This is a small collection of effects written in AS3.  Currently there is only
one effect but I intend to add more over time as I collect them from previous
projects and as I create new ones.  Please add more effects if you like!

Wisp Effect
-----------

The wisp effect generates randomly moving wisps of colour based on several
parameters.  It also dispatches an event when the wisp completes (if told to
do so) indicating the location of the end of its path.
